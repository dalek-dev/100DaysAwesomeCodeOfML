<h1>100 Days Of ML - LOG</h1>
<h2>Day 0 : July  06, 2018</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress :</strong> Today, I will look for documentation on various topics, 
and decide which is the one that best suits what I want to develop for this awesome challenge.

<strong>Thoughts :</strong> I'm going to turn this ML learning path into something great, 
I want to share it with everyone, my failures, and advances, this will be a memorable 100 days of adventure.

<h2>Day 1 : July  07, 2018</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress :</strong> I have found my topic to explore in these 100 days of ML, I will investigate moving clothes about people, and if it is possible to change clothes, in videos or moving recordings, using Machine Learning or Deep Learning as a resource.

<strong>Thoughts :</strong> I will try to use pytorch or tensorflow the one that has the best resources for its use to be optimized, I will be documenting and learning from everything that I review through this log.
